# dotfiles

My dotfiles and some scaffolding for bootstrapping new boxes.

Based on org-mode and org-mode-babel.

## To install

You'll need org-mode and org-mode-babel around. 
You'll probably need emacs newer than ~22 for that, but the installed configuration is tailored to >=25.

If you still want to install this:

    git clone https://github.com/bbenne10/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
